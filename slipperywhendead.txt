Too Happy to Be Alive:
[Verse 1]
We're still breathing
This can't be love
Baby, we're trying
Shed a few tears more
Oh, we keep on running
Just to get caught
And we know this is
Exactly what we want

[Chorus]
We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)
We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)

[Verse 2]
Now we feel it coming
Piercing our hearts
Fingers crossed
And we're praying nothing goes wrong
And finally, it's happening
Just a knock on our door
Our hearts are beating
Oh, it's just begun

[Chorus]
We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)

We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)
[Chorus]
We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)

We fear for the best and hope for the worst
(Too happy to be alive)
What love's lies blessed, love's light cursed
(Too happy to be alive)

[Outro]
(Too happy, too happy)
And we're too happy to be alive
(Too happy, too happy)
And we're too happy to be alive
(Too happy, too happy)
'Cause we're too happy to be alive
Oh, my love, so...

Gone with the Sin:
[Verse 1]
I love your skin, oh, so white
I love your touch cold as ice
And I love every single tear you cry
I love the way you're losing your life
All the time

[Chorus]
Oh, my baby, how beautiful you are
Oh, my darling, completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
You're gone with the sin, my darling
Completely torn apart
[Verse 2]
I adore the despair in your eyes
I worship your lips once red as wine
I love your scent sending shivers down my spine
I just love the way you're running out of life
You do it all the time

[Chorus]
Oh, my baby, how beautiful you are
Oh, my darling, completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
You're gone with the sin, my darling
Completely torn apart

[Refrain]
Skin so white
And your touch cold as ice
Tears you cry
You're losing your life
Despair in your eyes
Lips once red as wine
Sending shivers
Right down my spine

[Chorus]
Oh, my baby, how beautiful you are
Oh, my darling, completely torn apart
Gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
You're gone with the sin, my darling
Completely torn apart

Bury Me Deep Inside Your Heart:
[Verse 1]
Let me wake up in your arms
Hear you say, "It's not all right"
Let me be so dead and gone
So far away from life
Close my eyes
Hold me tight
And bury me deep inside your heart

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was you, my love
You're all I ever wanted
Just you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, yes, you
[Verse 2]
Let me never see the sun
And never see you smile
Let us be so dead and so gone
So far away from life
Just close my eyes
Hold me tight
And bury me deep inside your heart

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted... my love
You're all I ever wanted, just you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, just you, my love
'Cause all I ever wanted was you, my love

[Bridge]
Still, you look like you don't believe
My heaven is in your heart, baby
And that's the way it's always been
My heaven is only in your heart, baby
Your heart, darling

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was you, my love
You're all I ever wanted, just you, my love
'Cause all I ever wanted was you, oh, my love
You're all I ever wanted, yes, you, my love
'Cause it was you (oh, my love)
'Cause you're all I wanted (is you), my love
It was always you, oh, my love
And it was always just you, my love

Razorblade Romance [616 Edit MMXVI] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I taste death in every kiss we share
And every sundown seems to be the last we have
Your breath on my skin
Has the scent of the end
I'm drunk on your tears, baby
Can't you see I'm bleeding?

[Bridge]
Inside you, I am free
And I'm still waiting
Won't you let me dream
With you, baby?
And I'm afraid to feel
I'm afraid you love me
'Cause you are the one, oh...
You are the one, my love
[Verse 2]
Every time we touch, we get closer to heaven
And at every sunrise, our sins are forgiven
You on my skin, this must be the end
The only way you can love me is to cut me again
And again and again and again and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Inside you, I am free
And I'm still waiting
Won't you let me dream
With you, baby?
And I'm afraid to feel
I'm afraid you love me
'Cause you are the one

[Chorus]
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
Sweetest is the taste from your lips

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the taste from your lips
Oh, the taste from your lips
Oh, just the taste from those lips
Oh, the taste from your lips
[Pre-Chorus]
Only inside, I am free
I'm tired of waiting
You've got to let me dream
Inside you, baby
I'm not afraid to feel
I want you to love me
'Cause you are the one
'Cause you are the one
'Cause you are the one

[Chorus]
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
And the sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
And the sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
And the sweetest is the taste from your lips
Your love is a razorblade’s kiss
And the sweetest is the taste from your lips

Poison Girl:
[Verse 1]
We are so young
Our lives have just begun
But already, we're considering
Escape from your world
Waited for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
In death

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're all I want
And you're all that I have
So, let this be the end
And soon, we'll turn blue
Won't you take me with you?
For this world is a lonely place
Won't you please take me with you?
[Chorus]
I did it all just for her
Yes, I did it all just for her
And love wants us dead
Just me and my poison girl

I did it all just for her
Yes, I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl, oh

[Verse 2]
Cut my wrists
I'm open wide for you
Turning paler and I'm dying
To be with you
There is no way
No way we can lose
Before life tears us apart
Let death consume us

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're all I want
'Cause you're all I have
Let this be the end
And soon, we'll turn blue
Yes, I want to go with you

And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl

[Outro]
I did it all just for her
Yes, I did it all just for her
And love wants us dead
Just me and my poison girl

I did it all just for her
Yes, I did it all just for her
Love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl, oh

Resurrection:
[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I could breathe my life into you
One by one
Your pale fingers started to move
And I touched your face
And all death was erased
You smiled like an angel
Fallen from grace

[Chorus]
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection
[Verse 2]
You kissed my lips
With those once-cold fingertips
You brought me back to life
Life
All things come to an end
We don't have to pretend
To fall asleep
Just to wake up again

[Chorus]
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection

[Chorus]
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love
From the moment we touched
We keep begging for more
Of this resurrection
[Outro]
Of this resurrection
Of this resurrection
Of this resurrection

Right Here in My Arms:
[Verse 1]
The sun that she can't stand
Won't ever leave her alone
So now she's smiling
Like heaven's down on earth
And all her wishes
They finally come true
Her heart is weeping
This happiness is killing her
Crushing her
[Chorus]
'Cause she'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go

[Verse 2]
The sun is shining
Too bright on her
Again, her heart is weeping
This happiness is killing her
It's crushing her heart
The sun that she's kissing
Won't ever leave her alone
Never let her go

[Chorus]
'Cause she'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go
[Refrain]
The sun that she's kissing
Won't ever leave her alone
Never let her go

[Chorus]
'Cause she'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go

She'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go
She'll be right here in these arms
Waiting for love
She'll be waiting in these arms
She can't let go

[Outro]
She'll be right here in these arms
